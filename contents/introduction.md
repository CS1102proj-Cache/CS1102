#### Introduction
##### A. Introducing Caches
Cache memory, or cache, is a type of high-speed memory. It is a temporary data storage unit for frequently accessed data. Caches can be a hardware or software component that is commonly used by central processor units (CPUs), web browsers, applications, and operating systems.

##### B. Caches in Computer Systems
⁤CPU performs as a tool to process tasks and execute instructions in a computer system. ⁤⁤It requires data that originally stored in the memory components of the system to perform the tasks. ⁤⁤As for the main memory (random access memory, RAM), it acts as the primary storage unit. ⁤⁤These days, modern CPUs are advanced such that it usually takes more time to perform data retrieval from the main memory than actually performing the tasks themselves. ⁤⁤Hence, the CPU usually remains idle while waiting for the data, causing performance bottlenecks which lowers the efficiency of the operations with CPU. ⁤ The CPU cache acts as a temporary high-speed holding area between the CPU and the main memory to accelerate the data retrieval process and input-output operations.
