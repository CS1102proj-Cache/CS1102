title: Experiencing Cache
---

<body>
Cache memory from the CPU is difficult to experience so we will be using another approach with a similar concept using caches from websites. We can test it using these steps:<br/>
<br/><ol>
  <li>Clear the browser cache in your browser settings to clear all cache for the test.</li>
  <li>Enter any website you like and note how long it loads (using a stopwatch).</li>
  <li>Exit the website.</li>
  <li>Enter the website again and notice how much quicker it takes to load now.</li>
</ol><br/>
Browsers receive website content from web servers which takes time. Browser caches store website content in the deviceâ€™s hard drive to make access to frequently visited websites more efficient and bypass the need to retrieve data from web servers.
